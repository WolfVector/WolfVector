### Hey :smiley:, my name is Alejandro
Here you will find some fun projects, all of them have served me to learn about new language and frameworks like react, nextjs, laravel, python and javascript.

I've been learning data science and I love it. You can find my notebooks on my website.



Skills: python / react / nextjs / javascript / laravel / ruby on rails
